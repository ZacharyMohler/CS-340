## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The main thing I do to ensure the maintainability and readability of my code is to write comments throughout my code. This is not only to explain the indended functionality, but also to convey my thought process and approach to future developers that may need to implement or update my code. This also helps the adaptability of my code, as those developers will have insight on my exact line of thinking. 

In project 2, this greatly benefitted me--I can't always remember why or how I approached a problem a certain way, so I almost take on the role of that other developer and use my own comments to understand my previous thinking. 

I could use this CRUD Python module in the future when developing a program for my personal use. I plan to develop a program to store information about my book collection, and using the python CRUD module will greatly help when creating the database. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach to this project has been the same approach I've always taken when attempting to solve a computer science problem. 
1) Gathering and defining requirements.
it is tremendously important to understand the problem that you wish to solve, so I always ensure that I understand the problem before attempting to tackle the problem.
2) "Roughing out" an initial design.
on larger projects I will use diagrams to organize my thoughts, on smaller projects I will begin by creating the lowest level functionality I can.
3) "Fleshing out" the program that will address the requirements as they were gathered in 1, or how they have developed since. 

The number one technique I would use in the future (when available) to meet client needs is to maintain constant contact with the client--updating them on the current state, ensuring I'm addressing the proper problem, inquiring for changes in their requirements, etc.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
What computer scientists do matters because, in most cases, it helps other people complete their work easier. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, it changes his job from pouring over mountains of data to find the right candidate, to simply clicking a button and having every possible candidate immediately.
